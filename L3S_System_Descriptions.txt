TID System Description:

We used a rule based voting method that comprised of classification rules designed from the dry run queries, which if satisfied contributed a number of votes to a particular class. The rules used various features extracted from the query such as tense of the root verb, distance between the date identified in the query and query issue time and the multinomial distribution of the n-grams extracted from the queries. To understand the implicit temporal nature of a query, candidate years returned from the GTE web service(http://www.ccc.ipt.pt/~ricardo/software.html) was also used.

TDR System Description:

We used a learning to rank approach that used features extracted from verb tenses of sentences related to search queries or not in documents, similarity of the topic, subtopic against the title and content of the document, textual relevance score returned by statistical language model and temporal relevance based on the distribution of time references in the document with temporal intent specific filters. We trained separate learning to rank models for each temporal intent. In order to classify the subtopics into one of the temporal classes, a joint classifier based on verb tense and dictionary features was used. For the diversified results we combine the top 100 documents retrieved for each intent by computing the earth mover's distance between the distribution of time references in the diversified set and the distribution of time references in each of the remaining documents. We then consider the document with the maximum distance to be added to the diversified set.
